 * movie_open:  Open the given movie file and prepare it for playback.

 * If add_extension is true, a filename extension is appended to the given
 * pathname depending on the system:
 *    - Any system, if SIL_MOVIE_INCLUDE_WEBM is defined: ".webm"
 *    - PSP: ".str"
 *    - All others: ".webm"
 * If add_extension is false, the given pathname is used as is.
 *
 * [Parameters]
 *     path: Pathname (or resource name) of movie file to open.
 *     add_extension: True to add a default file extension; false to use
 *         the pathname as is.
 *     smooth_chroma: For movie formats with subsampled chroma data, true
 *         to linearly interpolate the chroma data when upsampling (slower
 *         but higher quality), false to use point sampling of chroma data
 *         (faster but lower quality).

 *
 * This function does nothing if the movie is already playing.
 *
 * This function may fail even after successfully opening a movie if, for
 * example, a required system resource is no longer available.
 *
 * Note that some systems are unable to return audio at the very beginning
 * of a movie stream.  SIL handles audio/video synchronization when
 * movie_update() and movie_draw() are used for playback, but you should
 * ensure that at least the first 0.25 seconds of the movie's audio stream
 * is silent in order to avoid audio glitches.

 *
 * Depending on the system and the movie format, it may not be possible to

 * the texture, this function returns without doing anything.
 *
 * For the purposes of this function, the "current" frame is determined
 * by multiplying the number of seconds since movie_play() was called (the
 * "current time") by the frame rate returned by movie_framerate() and
 * truncating the result to an integer.  However, if graphics_frame_period()
 * returns a nonzero value and the current time is less than half that
 * value before the next frame, the frame number is instead rounded up;
 * this reduces the risk of jitter caused by timing fluctuations.
 *
 * If movie_framerate() returns zero, this function behaves like
 * movie_next_frame().
 *
 * [Parameters]
 *     movie_id: Movie ID.

 *     True if the movie is still playing; false if the movie has finished.

/**
 * movie_draw:  Draw the currently loaded frame of the given movie to the
 * display.  The caller is responsible for setting appropriate coordinate
 * transformation matrices such that the frame can be rendered with its
 * upper-left corner at (0,0) and its lower-right corner at (width,height).
 * If shader objects are enabled, the caller must install an appropriate
 * shader with the standard vertex attributes bound to vertex shader inputs
 * (however, the vertex color attribute is not used by this function and
 * does not need to be bound).
 *
 * This function may modify all aspects of rendering state except the
 * current framebuffer and coordinate transformation matrices.
 *
 * This function is provided only for convenience; the same result can be
 * obtained by retrieving the movie texture and rendering it on an
 * appropriately-sized quad.
 *
 * [Parameters]
 *     movie_id: Movie ID.
